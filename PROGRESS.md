# Development Progress

## April 10th, 2025

### Today's Achievements
- Implemented authentication system with protected routes and UI elements
- Added user login functionality with a secure password check
- Created `ProtectedComponent` wrapper for conditional UI rendering
- Added admin controls (edit/delete buttons) to all trade entries
- Integrated "Add New" buttons for each trade category that only appear when logged in
- Improved the Journal page with proper authentication integration
- Enhanced the BestTrades page with admin functionality
- Fixed styling and UI issues in the login modal

### Next Steps
1. Create form components for adding/editing trades
2. Implement detailed trade view pages
3. Set up data persistence with localStorage or a backend service
4. Add image upload capability for trade screenshots/charts
5. Add performance metrics and analytics dashboard
6. Set up GitHub Pages deployment
7. Add unit tests for components
8. Implement error handling and loading states
9. Implement filtering and search functionality
10. Add dark mode support (optional)

### Technical Debt
- Need to move static data from `trades.js` to a proper data store
- Add proper TypeScript types for trade data structures
- Improve form validation for trade data entry
- Add proper error boundaries
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons

### Notes
- Authentication is currently using a hardcoded password ("tradingpro") - consider a more secure approach for production
- UI responsiveness has improved but still needs refinement for mobile devices
- Consider reorganizing component structure as the application grows

## April 2nd, 2025

### Today's Achievements
- Created initial project structure for Trading Journal Portfolio
- Implemented main Journal page with three main sections:
  - Active Trades
  - Closed Trades
  - Trade Ideas
- Set up basic UI components using React and Tailwind CSS
- Implemented tab-based navigation for different trade categories
- Created responsive layouts for trade cards and grid systems

### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system for secure editing
2. Add detailed trade view pages for each trade type
3. Create data persistence layer (currently using static data)
4. Add form components for creating/editing trades
5. Implement filtering and search functionality
6. Add performance metrics and analytics dashboard
7. Set up GitHub Pages deployment
8. Add unit tests for components
9. Implement error handling and loading states
10. Add image upload capability for trade screenshots/charts

### Technical Debt
- Need to move static data from `trades.js` to a proper data store
- Add proper TypeScript types for trade data structures
- Implement proper state management solution (Context API or Redux)
- Add proper error boundaries
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons

### Notes
- Current implementation uses mock data structure that will need to be replaced with real data persistence
- UI is responsive but needs more polish and animations
- Consider adding dark mode support
- Need to implement proper form validation
