# Development Progress

## April 2nd, 2025

### Today's Achievements
- Created initial project structure for Trading Journal Portfolio
- Implemented main Journal page with three main sections:
  - Active Trades
  - Closed Trades
  - Trade Ideas
- Set up basic UI components using React and Tailwind CSS
- Implemented tab-based navigation for different trade categories
- Created responsive layouts for trade cards and grid systems

### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system for secure editing
2. Add detailed trade view pages for each trade type
3. Create data persistence layer (currently using static data)
4. Add form components for creating/editing trades
5. Implement filtering and search functionality
6. Add performance metrics and analytics dashboard
7. Set up GitHub Pages deployment
8. Add unit tests for components
9. Implement error handling and loading states
10. Add image upload capability for trade screenshots/charts

### Technical Debt
- Need to move static data from `trades.js` to a proper data store
- Add proper TypeScript types for trade data structures
- Implement proper state management solution (Context API or Redux)
- Add proper error boundaries
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons

### Notes
- Current implementation uses mock data structure that will need to be replaced with real data persistence
- UI is responsive but needs more polish and animations
- Consider adding dark mode support
- Need to implement proper form validation
